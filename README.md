## ðŸŽ¯ About The Project

This script provides a quick and easy way to turn your e-books into audio files. It uses `epub2txt` to extract the text content from an EPUB file and then leverages `pyttsx3` to synthesize that text into speech, saving it as an MP3 file.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [epub2txt](https://pypi.org/project/epub2txt/)
* [pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/)
